//! This is *only* here to allow documentation tests
//! Unforunately, it seems that documentation tests are run
//! by compiling the library and then referncing into it, as per normal.
//! This means that we can *only* run tests on **Public** functions.
//! Unlike typical code tests, the documentation tests are *not*
//! run in the scope of module where they are written.
